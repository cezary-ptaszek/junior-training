# Universality tasks - Junior Python Dev - HCL
## Zad. 1.
Write a program that reads a number x and a positive integer n from the standard input and prints out x, 2x, ..., (n-1)x, nx to the standard output.

Consider the edge cases, e.g. n=1.

Input
Space separated two positive integers x and n.

Output
Integers x, 2x, ..., (n-1)x, nx, each in a separate line

Example\
Input:\
15 3

Output:\
15\
30\
45

## Zad. 2.
Write a program that reads from the standard input and will return the:

sum
difference
product
of all elements in the given list.

Input
An integer n (1 <= n <= 500) that denotes the number of elements in the list. The following n integers are the next elements of the list.

Output
Three integers:

sum
difference
product
of all the elements of the list.

Example\
Input:\
3\
4\
1\
6

Output:\
11\
-3\
24
